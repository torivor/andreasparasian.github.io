Welcome to my digital profile! My name is Andreas Parasian. I am an Undergraduate Industrial Engineering Student at Universitas Indonesia. I'm very interested in researching the implementation of data mining (e.g. pattern mining, process mining) and prescriptive analytic methodologies in various industries. I believe that these methodologies enable businesses to stay ahead of the curve by not only providing the description and the prediction of the current business environment but also recommending impactful actions that businesses should consider to improve their offerings and profitability.
