Welcome to my blog! My name is Andreas Parasian. I am an Undergraduate Industrial Engineering Student at Universitas Indonesia. Throughout my college degree, I've done various internships and competitions to understand how businesses can benefit from data-driven business decisions. Some of my notable experiences include recommending a business expansion for <a href="https://app.kinobi.asia/">Kinobi Asia</a>, data package price optimization for <a href="https://www.myorbit.id/">Telkomsel Orbit</a>, and numerous automation of <a href="https://www.yummycorp.com/">Yummy Corp.</a> business processes. Currently, I'm looking for more learning opportunities and chances to apply what I've learned to deliver impactful recommendations for businesses.
